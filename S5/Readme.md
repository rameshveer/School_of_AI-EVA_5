Target:

1. Get the set-up right
2. Set Transforms
3. Set Data Loader
4. Set Basic Working Code
5. Set Basic Training  & Test Loop

Results:

1. Parameters: 6.3M
2. Best Training Accuracy: 100.00
3. Best Test Accuracy: 99.28

Analysis:

1. Extremely Heavy Model for such a problem
2. Model is over-fitting, but we are changing our model in the next step
